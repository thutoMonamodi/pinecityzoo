                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok is a striking and majestic antelope species native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. With their long, straight horns and bold markings, gemsbok are built to survive in harsh desert environments. Their name comes from the Dutch word "gemsbok," which means chamois buck, though the two animals are not closely related.</p>

                    <p>Gemsbok are easily recognizable by their greyish-tan bodies, black-and-white facial patterns, and long, spear-like horns that can grow up to 85 centimeters (about 33 inches) in both males and females. These horns serve as a powerful defense mechanism against predators such as lions and hyenas. Despite their calm appearance, gemsbok can be fierce when threatened.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest primates on Earth and are among our closest relatives, sharing about 98% of their DNA with humans. These powerful yet gentle animals are native to the dense forests of central and western Africa. Gorillas are divided into two main species — the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla — each with two subspecies, including the critically endangered mountain gorilla.</p>

                    <p>With broad chests, long muscular arms, and intelligent eyes, gorillas are truly impressive animals. Males are significantly larger than females and are known as "silverbacks" once they reach maturity, named for the patch of silver hair that grows across their backs. A silverback leads the group, or troop, making decisions, protecting members, and maintaining order.</p>
                    
                    <p>Gorillas are herbivores, feeding mainly on leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo. They spend most of their day foraging and resting. Although they can climb trees, they are mostly ground-dwelling and use a special form of locomotion called "knuckle-walking," where they walk on all fours using their knuckles to support their weight.</p>
                    
                    <p>Social behavior is extremely important to gorillas. They live in tight-knit family groups that display affection, playfulness, and cooperation. Mothers are deeply nurturing, carrying their young and caring for them for several years. Gorillas also communicate using a variety of vocalizations, gestures, facial expressions, and even chest-beating — a behavior often misunderstood as aggression but actually used for communication and display.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite their size and strength, gorillas are generally peaceful and shy animals. Sadly, they face serious threats from habitat destruction, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts have become increasingly important to protect these incredible animals and the forests they call home.</p>
                    
                    <p>At our zoo, we are proud to provide a spacious, forest-like enclosure that allows our gorillas to climb, explore, and engage in social interactions. Our caretakers work closely with them to ensure they are healthy and enriched, and we support global efforts to conserve wild gorilla populations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
                    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen G01, located in the rainforest section near the tropical bird aviary.</p>
