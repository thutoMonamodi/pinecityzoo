                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok is a striking and majestic antelope species native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. With their long, straight horns and bold markings, gemsbok are built to survive in harsh desert environments. Their name comes from the Dutch word "gemsbok," which means chamois buck, though the two animals are not closely related.</p>

                    <p>Gemsbok are easily recognizable by their greyish-tan bodies, black-and-white facial patterns, and long, spear-like horns that can grow up to 85 centimeters (about 33 inches) in both males and females. These horns serve as a powerful defense mechanism against predators such as lions and hyenas. Despite their calm appearance, gemsbok can be fierce when threatened.</p>
                    
                    <p>Adapted to desert life, gemsbok can survive long periods without drinking water. They get most of the moisture they need from the plants they eat, including dry grasses, roots, and desert succulents. Their kidneys are highly efficient, helping them conserve water in the hot, dry climate.</p>
                    
                    <p>These antelope are social animals and usually live in small herds of 10 to 40 individuals. The herds are typically made up of females and their young, while males may either remain in bachelor groups or hold territories. Within the herd, they communicate using body language and vocalizations, including snorts and grunts.</p>
                    
                    <p>Gemsbok are active mainly in the early morning and late afternoon when the desert heat is less intense. They rest in shaded areas during the hottest part of the day. Their light-colored coats help reflect sunlight, and the dark patches on their legs and underbellies help dissipate heat.</p>
                    
                    <p>At our zoo, the gemsbok are housed in a specially designed habitat that mimics their native desert terrain, providing them with space to roam, graze, and rest comfortably. Our care team ensures they are healthy, enriched, and able to express their natural behaviors.</p>
                    
                    <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
                    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen G12, near the desert habitat exhibit and close to the reptile house.</p>
