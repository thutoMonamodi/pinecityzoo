                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok is a striking and majestic antelope species native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. With their long, straight horns and bold markings, gemsbok are built to survive in harsh desert environments. Their name comes from the Dutch word "gemsbok," which means chamois buck, though the two animals are not closely related.</p>

                    <p>Koalas are one of Australia's most beloved and iconic animals, known for their fluffy ears, button noses, and relaxed lifestyle. Despite being commonly called “koala bears,” they are not bears at all — koalas are marsupials, meaning they carry and raise their young in a pouch. These tree-dwelling mammals are native to the eucalyptus forests along the eastern coast of Australia.</p>

                    <p>Koalas have a specialized diet, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. These leaves are tough, low in nutrients, and toxic to most animals, but koalas have a highly adapted digestive system that allows them to process them safely. Their large cecum and long digestive tract help break down the fibrous leaves and detoxify the chemicals. Because eucalyptus leaves provide little energy, koalas sleep up to 18 to 22 hours a day to conserve energy.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although they look cuddly, koalas have sharp claws and strong limbs that allow them to grip tree branches securely. They spend most of their lives in trees, rarely coming down to the ground. Their thick fur protects them from both hot and cold temperatures, and their padded bottoms make sitting in trees more comfortable for long periods.</p>
                    
                    <p>Koalas are generally solitary and territorial animals. Males are larger than females and can be recognized by a dark scent gland on their chests, which they use to mark trees in their territory. During the breeding season, males produce loud bellows to attract females and ward off rivals. Baby koalas, called joeys, are born tiny and undeveloped. They crawl into their mother’s pouch where they continue developing for about six months before emerging and riding on her back.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sadly, koalas face significant threats in the wild, including habitat destruction, bushfires, disease, and vehicle strikes. Conservation efforts are critical to protect their natural habitats and ensure their survival for future generations. Zoos and wildlife sanctuaries play an important role in these efforts by providing safe environments, breeding programs, and public education.</p>
                    
                    <p>At our zoo, our koalas live in a specially designed eucalyptus habitat that allows them to climb, rest, and feed in a naturalistic setting. Keepers ensure they receive a fresh supply of eucalyptus leaves daily, and visitors can observe them up close during their quiet, peaceful moments — often perched high in the trees, snoozing the day away.</p>
                    
                    <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
                    <p>You will find the koalas at pen A05, located in the Australian Bushwalk section near the café.</p>
                       <p>You will find the gorillas at pen G01, located in the rainforest section near the tropical bird aviary.</p>
