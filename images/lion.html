                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>Lions are among the most powerful and iconic animals in the animal kingdom, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," even though they actually live in grasslands and savannas rather than jungles. Native to Africa and a small region in India, lions are known for their strength, majestic appearance, and complex social structures. Males are easily recognized by their thick, flowing manes, which vary in color and size and can indicate age, genetics, and health.</p>

<p>Unlike most big cats, lions are social animals that live in groups called prides. A pride typically consists of several related females, their offspring, and one to three dominant males. The females do most of the hunting, working together to take down prey such as zebras, wildebeests, and antelope, while the males defend the pride’s territory from intruders and rival males. This cooperation makes them highly effective predators.</p>

<p>Lions are apex predators but will also scavenge from other animals when the opportunity arises. They can eat up to 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of meat in a single meal. After a large meal, lions often spend the rest of the day resting. In fact, lions are one of the laziest of the big cats, sleeping or lounging for up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy for hunting and patrolling.</p>

<p>The roar of a lion is one of the most powerful sounds in the animal kingdom and can be heard up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) away. Roaring helps to communicate with pride members and to warn off potential threats or rivals. Lions also use body language, scent markings, and facial expressions to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Young lions, known as cubs, are born after a gestation period of around 110 days. Cubs are typically hidden in dense vegetation for the first few weeks of life and are extremely vulnerable to predators. Female lions in a pride often synchronize births and help each other care for and protect the cubs, forming a strong community bond.</p>

<p>In the wild, lions face threats such as habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts and protected reserves are vital for maintaining healthy populations. Zoos also play an essential role in lion conservation, helping to raise awareness and support breeding programs to ensure their survival.</p>

<p>Our zoo’s lion habitat mimics the open savanna and includes shaded areas, elevated rock platforms, and space for roaming and play. Visitors can observe these magnificent cats up close and learn more about their behaviors, importance in the ecosystem, and the challenges they face in the wild.</p>

<h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
<p>You will find the lions at pen B03, located along the Big Cat Trail near the observation deck.</p>
