                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are truly remarkable creatures, not just because of their massive size but also due to their unique adaptations and complex behaviors. Found in both Africa and Asia, elephants play an important role in the ecosystems they inhabit. They are known for their long trunks, which serve as highly functional tools for breathing, smelling, drinking, grabbing objects, and making sounds. Each trunk contains over 40,000 muscles, giving it incredible strength and precision.</p>

                    <p>One of the most iconic features of elephants is their ivory tusks, which are actually elongated incisor teeth. African elephants of both sexes typically have tusks, while in Asian elephants, usually only the males do. These tusks are used for digging, lifting objects, stripping bark from trees, and defense. Unfortunately, they have also made elephants a target for illegal poaching, contributing to the species' decline.</p>
                    
                    <p>Elephants are herbivores with a huge appetite, consuming up to 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of food each day. Their diet includes grasses, fruits, bark, leaves, and roots. Due to their size and the amount of food they eat, elephants spend a large portion of their day foraging. They also drink large amounts of water — up to 200 liters (about 50 gallons) a day — and love to cool off by bathing in rivers or spraying water and mud onto themselves, which also acts as a natural sunscreen and insect repellent.</p>
                    
                    <p>Socially, elephants are incredibly intelligent and emotional animals. They live in close-knit family groups led by a matriarch — usually the oldest and most experienced female. These herds are known for their strong bonds, cooperative behavior, and emotional depth. Elephants have been observed mourning their dead, comforting one another, and even displaying joy and playfulness.</p>
                    
                    <p>Communication among elephants is equally impressive. They produce a variety of sounds, some of which are infrasound — low-frequency calls that can travel several kilometers. These calls help them coordinate movement, warn of danger, or find other groups. They also use touch, sight, and scent to communicate, making their interactions deeply complex.</p>
                    
                    <p>Calves, or baby elephants, weigh about 100 kilograms (220 pounds) at birth and are cared for by the entire herd. Elephants show great patience and affection toward their young, with aunts and older siblings often helping to raise them. This communal care ensures that the calves grow up well-protected and learn essential skills for survival.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite their size, elephants are agile and can move surprisingly quickly when needed. They are also good swimmers, using their trunks as snorkels when crossing deep rivers. Elephants tend to sleep very little — only about 2 to 4 hours a day — and often do so while standing up.</p>
