                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with adult males reaching heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet). Their most distinctive feature is their incredibly long necks, which contain the same number of vertebrae as a human neck — just elongated. These gentle giants are native to the savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of Africa, where their height gives them an advantage when foraging for food in tall trees.</p>

<p>Giraffes feed primarily on the leaves of acacia trees, using their long, prehensile tongues — which can be up to 45 centimeters (18 inches) long — to grasp and strip foliage. Their tongues and lips are tough and specially adapted to handle the sharp thorns of their favorite trees. They spend much of their day browsing, often eating hundreds of kilograms of leaves each week.</p>

<p>Despite their long legs and height, giraffes are surprisingly graceful and can run at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph) over short distances. Their gait is unique: when walking, they move both legs on one side of their body at the same time, giving them a rocking motion. They also have powerful hearts and a specialized blood pressure system to pump blood all the way up to their brains.</p>

<p>Giraffes are social animals, often found in loose herds that can change members from day to day. These groups are usually peaceful and non-territorial. Males sometimes engage in “necking” battles — a behavior where they swing their necks at each other to establish dominance, though serious injuries are rare.</p>

<p>Calves are born after a 15-month gestation period and can stand within an hour of birth. They are vulnerable to predators like lions and hyenas, but mothers are extremely protective. Young giraffes grow quickly and begin feeding on leaves within a few weeks while continuing to nurse for several months.</p>

<p>Sadly, giraffe populations have declined significantly in the wild due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and raise awareness about their plight. Zoos play an important role in educating the public and supporting breeding programs for giraffe conservation.</p>

<p>Our zoo provides a spacious and enriching environment for our giraffes, complete with tall trees, feeding platforms, and room to roam. Guests can observe their graceful movements up close and learn more about what makes these towering animals so extraordinary.</p>

<h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen S14, near the Savanna Trail lookout point.</p>
