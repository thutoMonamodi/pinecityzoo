                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family known for their rugged appearance, distinctive facial “warts,” and curved tusks. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, warthogs are commonly found in savannas, open woodlands, and grasslands where they graze and root for food. Despite their somewhat intimidating look, warthogs are generally shy and prefer to flee rather than fight when threatened.</p>

                    <p>The name "warthog" comes from the thick, protective pads or “warts” on their faces, which are actually fatty tissue used for defense during fights, especially among males. Both males and females have tusks, but the males’ are more prominent. These tusks are used for digging, fighting, and defending themselves from predators such as lions, leopards, and hyenas.</p>
                    
                    <p>Warthogs are primarily herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and bark. However, they are also known to occasionally eat insects, eggs, and even small animals. Their tough snouts and strong hooves help them dig into the ground to find roots and bulbs, particularly during dry seasons when surface vegetation is scarce.</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the warthog’s most charming behaviors is its habit of kneeling on its front legs while feeding. This is because their necks are short and their legs relatively long, making it more comfortable to graze by bending down. Despite their awkward-looking stance, warthogs are surprisingly fast runners and can reach speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph) when escaping danger.</p>
                    
                    <p>Warthogs often take shelter in abandoned burrows, which they back into so they can face outward and quickly defend themselves or escape if necessary. These burrows also provide protection from predators and extreme weather. Females raise their young in these safe spaces, usually giving birth to a litter of two to four piglets after a gestation period of about six months.</p>
                    
                    <p>Socially, warthogs are fairly adaptable. Females and their young tend to form small family groups called sounders, while males are more solitary but may join the groups during mating season. Warthogs communicate through grunts, squeals, and tail movements, and they are often seen with their tails held upright while running — a funny but practical signal to help family members follow each other through tall grass.</p>
                    
                    <p>At our zoo, the warthogs reside in a spacious, savanna-inspired habitat that encourages their natural behaviors like digging, grazing, and wallowing in mud. Visitors often enjoy watching them trot around energetically or roll in the mud — a behavior that helps them cool down and protect their skin from insects and the sun.</p>
                    
                    <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
                    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen D07, near the Safari Plains exhibit next to the meerkats.</p>
