                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>Pandas, officially known as giant pandas, are among the most beloved animals in the world. Native to the mountainous regions of central China, these gentle giants are instantly recognizable by their black-and-white fur, round faces, and peaceful demeanor. Despite their bear-like appearance, pandas are unique among bears due to their primarily vegetarian diet and solitary lifestyle.</p>

<p>Although they belong to the carnivore order, over 99% of a giant panda's diet consists of bamboo. They spend up to 12 hours a day eating and can consume 12 to 38 kilograms (26 to 84 pounds) of bamboo daily. Their powerful jaws and strong molars allow them to crush even the toughest stalks. Despite bamboo being low in nutrients, pandas have evolved to process large quantities to meet their energy needs.</p>

<p>Pandas have a special adaptation to help them feed — a modified wrist bone that acts like a thumb, allowing them to grip bamboo stalks with surprising dexterity. While they occasionally eat small animals or eggs, bamboo remains the primary food source throughout their lives. Because bamboo is not very energy-dense, pandas move slowly and spend much of their time resting to conserve energy.</p>

<p>Giant pandas are solitary by nature, marking their territory with scent and avoiding others except during the brief mating season. Mothers give birth to one or two cubs, but typically only one survives in the wild. Panda cubs are born tiny, blind, and helpless, weighing just 100 to 150 grams (3 to 5 ounces). They rely entirely on their mothers for warmth, protection, and nourishment during their first few months of life.</p>

<p>Sadly, pandas have faced a long history of endangerment due to habitat loss, deforestation, and low birth rates. Thanks to extensive conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and international breeding programs, giant pandas have been reclassified from "endangered" to "vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List — a major success story in wildlife conservation.</p>

<p>In our zoo, pandas live in a tranquil, naturalistic enclosure designed to replicate the bamboo forests of China. Their habitat includes climbing structures, cozy resting spots, and a constant supply of fresh bamboo. Visitors can watch these peaceful animals as they munch away or nap in the shade, offering a rare and unforgettable wildlife experience.</p>

<h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
<p>You will find the pandas at pen C09, tucked away in the Bamboo Grove section beside the Asian Forest exhibit.</p>
