                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Lions are among the most powerful and iconic animals in the animal kingdom, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," even though they actually live in grasslands and savannas rather than jungles. Native to Africa and a small region in India, lions are known for their strength, majestic appearance, and complex social structures. Males are easily recognized by their thick, flowing manes, which vary in color and size and can indicate age, genetics, and health.</p>

                    <p>Monkeys are some of the most fascinating and playful animals in the animal kingdom. Known for their intelligence, agility, and curiosity, monkeys are part of the primate family and are found in a wide range of environments across Africa, Asia, Central and South America. There are over 260 species of monkeys, broadly classified into two groups: Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (from the Americas).</p>

                    <p>Old World monkeys, such as baboons and macaques, usually live on the ground or in trees and have narrow, downward-facing nostrils. Many have cheek pouches to store food and some even have short tails or no tails at all. New World monkeys, like capuchins and howler monkeys, live almost entirely in trees and have prehensile tails that can grasp and hold objects, functioning like an extra limb.</p>
                    
                    <p>Monkeys are highly social animals that live in groups called troops. These groups can range in size from a few individuals to several dozen, depending on the species. Within a troop, monkeys communicate using a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, body postures, and even grooming behaviors. Grooming not only keeps them clean but also strengthens social bonds.</p>
                    
                    <p>Their diet varies by species but generally includes fruits, leaves, flowers, seeds, insects, and sometimes small animals or bird eggs. Their clever hands and excellent coordination allow them to peel fruit, crack nuts, and even use basic tools in some species. Some monkeys, like capuchins, have been observed using sticks to fish for insects or rocks to crack open hard shells.</p>
                    
                    <p>Monkeys are extremely intelligent and are often studied for their problem-solving abilities and memory skills. In the wild, they learn by observing others and passing down knowledge from one generation to the next. Many species are known for their playful behavior, such as swinging from branches, chasing each other, or engaging in games with objects they find.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, monkeys face serious threats in the wild due to deforestation, habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. Conservation efforts and protected reserves are vital to ensure their survival, and zoos play a key role in education and breeding programs to protect endangered species.</p>
                    
                    <p>At our zoo, we house several monkey species in large, enriching enclosures that allow for climbing, swinging, and exploration. Our primate team provides them with daily enrichment activities to keep their minds and bodies active. Watching monkeys interact with each other and their environment is always a highlight for zoo visitors!</p>
                    
                    <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
                    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen M12, in the Primate Pavilion near the Jungle Walk path.</p>
